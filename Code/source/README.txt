Your job is to fill out the SpawnBullet function inside of the
GameState.h. Most of the work is already done, but you will need
to analyze what's going on to figure out what you need to do.

Think of the source code as a small book, and whenever you reach
a function or class you don't know about, look up the definition to
see what it does.

'A' 'D' 'F' are the controls (left, right, fire).
